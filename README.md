</br></br>


## Limitations
Currently, the project faces the following limitations : 
1. Incoming vehicles unable to turn on curved road
2. Camera fixed when user goes through curved road

In order to make the vehicle drift on the curved, several attempts has been made to translate the car on the curved road as follows :

https://github.com/juho-creator/VirtualWorlds/assets/72856990/ba0d4062-43ab-466e-ae2f-ab77efc327a9

The car began to translate only at the edge of the curve, not while entering it. </br>
Hence, this malfunctioning code was removed to prevent any confusion in the process of grading the assignment.
</br></br>



## Concepts used
- Trigonometric Functions
- Meshes & Quads
