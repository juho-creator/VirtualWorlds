</br></br>


## Limitations

Currently, the project faces the following limitations:

1. Incoming vehicles are unable to turn on curved roads.
2. The camera remains fixed when the user navigates through curved roads.
</br></br>


## Attempts to Overcome Limitations

</br>

- **Enabling Vehicle Movement on Curved Roads**  
  Several attempts have been made to enable vehicles to drift on curved roads. </br>
  After endless trial and errors, the vehicle was able to translate on the curved road as follows:

However the vehicle began to drift only at the edge of the curve, rather than upon entering it. </br>
  
- **Maintaining Camera Distance from the Vehicle**  
  The camera has been programmed to maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to ensure an optimal viewpoint. While the camera successfully tracks the vehicle on straight roads, it struggled to rotate adequately on curved roads.
